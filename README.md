# CCAM-DI
This repository implements a MARL-based autonomous intersection control system using PPO for learning vehicle policies and the SUMO traffic simulation. It evaluates robustness against data integrity attacks where malicious vehicles spoof position data. Experiments analyze training vs test-time perturbations and their impact on collision avoidance.
